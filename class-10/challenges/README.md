# Ops Challenge: Advanced Event Logging with Sysmon 

## Overview

Our next focus in this course on how we can aggregate event logs, then analyze them effectively for signs of attack. Our first step in this journey is familiarizing with a popular industry tool called Sysmon. Sysmon is a part of the powerful Windows Sysinternals toolkit from Microsoft, and is able to greatly improve the quality and detail of logs generated by Windows systems.
